# AirBnB Clone

The goal of this project is to deploy a simple copy of the [AirBnB Website](https://www.airbnb.com/) on your server.

## Steps

To achieve this, we will divide the project into the following steps:

### Step 1: The Console

-   In this step, we will focus on creating the data model and implementing a console to manage objects. The console will allow us to perform operations such as creating, updating, and destroying objects.

-   In this step, we will implement a mechanism to store and persist objects to a file. We will use a JSON file to store the object data.

## Getting Started with the console

To get started with this project, follow the steps below:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Navigate to the project directory.

3. Run the console application by executing the following command:

    ```python
    python console.py
    ```

    This will launch the console where you can manage objects.

4. Perform operations such as creating, updating, and destroying objects using the console commands.

5. Objects will be stored and persisted to a JSON file automatically.

6. Explore the code and customize it to fit your needs.

7. Enjoy using your own AirBnB clone!

> Note: Make sure you have Python installed on your machine before proceeding with the above steps.
